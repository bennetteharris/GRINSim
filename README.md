# GRINSim
Varieties of Elitism Simulations using the GRIN model

This project consists of a set of perl scripts and modules designed to implement and compare various elitism strategies
under the GRIN model developed by Chris Santos-Lang.  The strategies implemented here were done in consultation with Chris 
Santos-Lang, and are intended to model as closely as possible the same-named strategies that appear in his published works.

In this initial release, I am simply uploading the code I have developed to seed the process.  In the coming days I will supply
detailed instructions for installing a test platform, running the code, and developing new models.
